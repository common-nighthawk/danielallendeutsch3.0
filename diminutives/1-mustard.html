  <strong>Mustard</strong>
  <small>January 29, 2017</small>
  <br><br>
  This story starts in 2010.
  I moved to Ithaca to spend the summer with my girlfriend.
  I discovered the grocery store Wegmans,
  and it totally knocked my socks off.
  Among other things, they have a really solid generic brand.
  That is, everything sold under the 'Wegmans' label is good.
  And not just a little good, but *very* good.
  <br><br>
  Anyway, I fell hard for their mustard.
  It's whole grain&mdash;and I loved it more than life.
  (I hate hate hate hate classic yellow mustard.)
  This mustard was the best, and it was cheap.
  <br><br>
  At the end of the summer, I moved to New York City
  and knew I'd be without Wegmans for a while.
  I still remember it&mdash;going to the market one last time
  and putting ~8 jars of mustard in the cart.
  <br><br>
  My girlfriend said No way.  Mustard goes bad, and I was getting way too much.
  We looked at the expiration date.
  November 2014. 4 years away.
  I'm doing it, I said. I need all this mustard.
  <br><br>
  I left New York 5 years later.
  I sold most of my stuff,
  and spent the better part of year traveling around the U.S.
  I still had two jars of mustard left&mdash;so I took them with me.
  <br><br>
  I cooked saugage tonight and opened the last jar.
  The glass says it was at its best up until 3 years ago.
  But I can confirm&mdash;still good.
  <br><br>
  I was wrong about how fast I'd go through it.
  But there has not been one single day since the summer of 2010
  where I opened the fridge and said, "Shit. Looks like I'm out of mustard."
  For 7 years, I've never had to worry.
  <br><br>
  It's been a good run. But soon enough, I'll be out.
