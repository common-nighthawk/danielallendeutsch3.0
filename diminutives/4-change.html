  <strong>On Changing Things Up</strong>
  <small>May 7, 2017</small>
  <br><br>
  I used to spend a few hours a week helping students learning to code.
  Two students would work through a problem together,
  and I'd offer hints when they got stuck
  and gently try to steer things in the right direction.
  <br><br>
  During one session, things weren't going great.
  One student suggested switching roles--changing
  who was driving (sharing their screen and doing the typing)--even
  through they weren't at a natural stopping point.
  <br><br>
  Things instantly got better.
  And, to be honest, for no apparent reason.
  <br><br>
  We talked about how helpful that had been at the end.
  The student said something like,
  "We weren't working together well,
  so I thought changing things up couldn't hurt."
  <br><br>
  I loved this, and I find it to be true.
  <br><br>
  I have a bad habit of hammering away at something until it works.
  Switch lines 3 and 4, trying renaming the variable, copy-pasta Stack Overflow.
  Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer--for 30 minutes.
  In a fit of frustration, I'll give up and decide to get a snack.
  <br><br>
  Within a few seconds of stepping away from my desk,
  I realize the concept I'd overlooked.
  I'd been too busy brute-forcing to think.
  <br><br>
  It's really easy to continue trying to force something that doesn't work.
  The good news, I have found, is that you don't need to know the answer.
  Try changing something, and see if that helps.
  Move seats, take a step back, try a different approach.
  <br><br>
  I used to live in New York.
  That stopped being good for me, so I moved across the country.
  This carried more risk than getting a snack,
  but worked out well for me.
  <br><br>
  Brute force is a bad approach to things that aren't working.
  Change it up; I think it'll help.
