  <strong>Uber</strong>
  <small>January 30, 2017</small>
  <br><br>
  Uber is kinda the least of it right now, given blatant human rights violations.
  But I wanted to add one thing. We should start acting sooner.
  <br><br>
  Uber routinely tracked individual riders (proudly, no less).
  They had no data privacy policy in place.
  It was also documented that a top executive wanted to dig up
  personal dirt on journalists providing bad press.
  These are both really really bad, but no one cared because Uber is super convenient.
  <br><br>
  There is lots of stuff like this that goes on.
  It's important to remember that by spending money somewhere,
  we help keep that company in business.
  We are constantly voting with our dollars&mdash;so let's be purposeful about it.
