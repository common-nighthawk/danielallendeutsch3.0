    <h3 class="blog-title center">Project #4: Sign Up Now</h3>
    <h6 class="blog-title center">September XX, 2016</h6>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      Passwords are the worst.
      I believe there is universal hatred for the phrase:
      "password must contain a special character".
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one service I use that requires passwords to be updated each month.
      My password started out as "MyPassword" (not really).
      And now it is "MyPassword!!!!!!" (really ending in 6 !'s).
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the idea to make a website to parody the process
      of signing up for a new service.
      It took more time than I expected,
      but I also learned more than I would have guesses.
      For that reason, I'll write about the process here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website is available here:
      <a href="http://sign-up-now.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">sign-up-now.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">The Specs</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>provide increasingly frustrating error messages</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I thought it would be funny for the messages
          to start out realistic ('password must be longer than 6 characters'),
          and get more and more absurd ('password must contain name of the capital and largest city of Qatar')
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>have no backend (HTML, CSS, JS only)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>this is a lightweight project</li>
        <li>
          there is no incredibly simple and cheap hosting solution for web apps,
          at least as compared to using
          <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html">AWS S3 for static sites</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>not look terrible</li>
      <ul>
        <li>no one will take a page seriously if it looks like trash</li>
        <li>
          I wanted to try and build a page without
          any frontend framework (i.e. Bootstrap)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">The Code</h5>
    <p>
      The code for this project is incredibly simple.
      <a href="https://github.com/common-nighthawk/sign-up-now">All of the files are publicly available</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">What Did I Learn (Technical)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">JavaScript</span> &mdash;
        this was my first time using Regular Expressions in JS.
        I didn't come across anything unexpected,
        but there are nuances to the different methods
        and building the RegEx
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Design</span> &mdash;
        I have a bad habit of slapping bootstrap on everything.
        I recently came across a great
        <a href="http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/">blog post</a>
        that convinced me decent design isn't too difficult.
        I stole all the code from that article, and
        I think the site looks pretty good for 66 lines of CSS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Web Accessibility</span> &mdash;
        I posted what I built a few places, and a friend wrote to tell me
        she thought it was neat but that my tiny page failed certain basic
        web accessibility standards. This ended up being a fun rabbit-hole
        to chase down, so deserves it's own section.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Web Accessibility</h5>
    <p>
      The web, on a fundamental level, should be accessible to everyone.
      This includes, as an example, people that are blind and color blind.
      If web pages are built properly, there are tools that allow all users
      to use your website. A common and important tool is a screen-reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Largely, if you use proper semantic HTML everything will take care of itself.
      But what if, for example, you put an &lt;h1&gt; on the page
      without any content? This is a common thing to do, if you plan to fill
      the h1 with dynamic content using JavaScript basic on some user-interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a sighted-up, this is no problem. But this messes up a screen-reader.
      It is assumed that an h1 contains the most important text on the page,
      and if it's empty things get confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you know that's a shitty thing to do,
      I hope you'll be more conscious of it
      <a href="#footer-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are things I did wrong&mdash;
      <ul>
        <li>
          all form fields should have a label associate with it.
          If not, a screen-reader cannot associate text with fields.
          <a href="https://github.com/common-nighthawk/sign-up-now/commit/b582c8ba2951a0ed8fbc7ae788cbb8e28e834790">
            Check out the commit
          </a>.
          The label has a <code>for</code> tag that links to the <code>id</code> of the form field.
        </li>
        <li>
          text should have at least a 4.5:1 color contrast with its background.
          Who knew? I found
          <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">an awesome website to help find alternate colors</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          if you add something important to a page (like an error message)
          without a new page load, that message needs to be announced
          by a screen-reader. HTML accepts
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">
            ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
          </a>
          specifically so the web works better for people with disabilities.
          I won't go into details, but
          <a href="https://github.com/common-nighthawk/sign-up-now/commit/e7ff5b104bebc04311e8ef1519ce8272e6d763dc">I added</a>
          an <code>aria-describedby</code>
          to link the error message to the password field. As a result,
          it is announced by the screen-reader.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">What Did I Learn (Non-Technical)</h5>
    <p>
      I often take on big projects (Project #3: Gain Fluency in Go)
      that have no obvious end. It was nice and fun
      building something with such a small scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, it's sometimes the quick features and projects
      that bring people the most joy.
      I spent a long time building a
      <a href="http://www.picturebookmylife.com/">big thing</a>
      I couldn't convince anyone to use.
      This took a few hours, and ~300 people played with it
      (small numbers for BuzzFeed, big numbers for me).
      Some people even reached out to say they got a big kick out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, wins beget wins. I didn't expect to learn about accessibility
      with this project. But if you build something and show it to people,
      it can led to unexpected places. Last week I knew nothing about
      web accessibility; now I know slightly more than that ðŸ˜€.

    TODO: write about being a good citizen
    low code, high upside
    a note about <code>cron</code>.
    I heard the term used for over a year, and always thought
    "I'm a web developer. That's a tool used by Systems people."
    <code>cron</code> is now one of my favorite tools.
    It comes in handy all of the time, and is simple to use.
    If you're not familiar with it, definitely check it out.
    It allows you to schedule recurring jobs.
