      If you're anything like me, you are always trying to find <span>stuff</span> on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did I save that file?  Is it buried in my home folder or on my desktop?"
      "Hm... I'm not sure where the config file is saved for this program."
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps someone calls you over because they need help looking at an EC2 instance used for the staging server, which is acting funky.

      I always find myself re-learning the commands. I cannot keep track of:
      1. which operations are recursive
      2. how each command handles partial matches and
      3. what acts on words in files vs file names vs directory names.
