    <p>
      If you're anything like me, you are always trying to find <span>stuff</span> on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did I save that file?  Is it buried in my home folder or on my desktop?"
      "Hm... I'm not sure where the config file for this program is stored."
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps someone calls you over because they need help looking at an EC2 instance used for the staging server&mdash;it's acting funky.
      You current knowledge about what this box does is tangential at best.
    </p>
    <p>The solution is easy.  Search for it!</p>
    <p>
      I always find myself re-learning the commands. I cannot keep track of:
      1. which operations are recursive
      2. how each command handles partial matches and
      3. what acts on words in files vs file names vs directory names.
    </p>
    <p>Let's go through them one-by-one.</p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Searching For a File</h5>
    <p><code>find -type f</code></p>
    <p>'find' takes a directory and looks recursively through it.</p>
    <p>Pass that you want a 'file' through the -type flag.</p>
    <p>Pass the name of the file through the -name flag (or -iname for case insensitive).</p>
    <p>The file must exactly match the name to return a result.
    If you do not know the exact name of the file, you can use * (asterisk), the wildcard matcher.</p>
    <p>Let's look at some examples:</p>

    <div class="examples">
      <p><span>I am looking for 'example.txt'.  I know I saved it in my home folder.</span></p>
      <pre>find ~/ -type f -name example.txt</pre>

      <p><span>I am looking for all css files in my blog folder.</span></p>
      <pre>find ~/blog -type f -name *.txt</pre>

      <p><span>I am looking for a file with 'ellowor' in the name. I know I saved it somewhere.</span></p>
      <pre>find / -type f -name *ellowor*</pre>
    </div>

    <p><code>locate</code></p>
    <p>'locate' is a newer and non-standard command, so it is not available on all operating systems.</p>
    <p>However, it is faster and better designed to find files when their location is unknown.</p>

    <div class="examples">
      <p><span>I am looking for a file with 'elephant' in the name across my machine.</span></p>
      <pre>locate elephant</pre>

      <p><span>I am looking for a file with 'eLePhAnt' in the name across my machine, but do not remember which letters are capitalized.</span></p>
      <pre>locate -i elephant</pre>
    </div>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Searching For a Directory</h5>
    <p><code>find -type d</code></p>
    <p>Good news&mdash;searching for a directory uses the same 'find' command.</p>
    <p>The only difference is the -type flag, which now take 'd'.</p>

    <div class="examples">
      <p><span>I am looking for a directory named 'my-files'.  I know it is nested in the home folder.</span></p>
      <pre>find ~/ -type d -name my-files</pre>

      <p><span>I am looking for all folders with 'important' in the name across my computer.</span></p>
      <pre>find / -type d -name *important*</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you are looking for either a file or directory, you can just leave off the -type flag
      and results of both will be returned.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Searching For Text Within a File</h5>
    <p><code>grep</code></p>

    <p>
      Have you ever been on a page on a web browser, looking for something specific, and your co-worker suggested you 'grep for it'.
      'Oh... just hit control F?'
      Let's explain why the word grep is used as a synonym for 'search for'.
    </p>

    <p>'grep' searches through a file or files looking for text matches within the document(s).  It is NOT recursive by default.</p>
    <p>If you want to recursively search through a folder, use the -r flag.</p>
    <p>This command WILL return partial matches, so if you grep for 'elloworl' the text 'helloworld' would be returned.</p>
    <p>A final set of examples:</p>

    <div class="examples">
      <p><span>I am looking to see if the file ~/poem.txt has the world 'sound' in it.</span></p>
      <pre>grep sound ~/poem.txt</pre>

      <p><span>Which of the .css files in my lists folder has the text 'twitter'?</span></p>
      <pre>grep twitter ~/lists/*.css</pre>

      <p><span>Of all the files in my important directory, which contain the word 'apple'?</span></p>
      <pre>grep -r apple ~/important/</pre>

      <p><span>Where did I save that file?  The only thing I remember about it is that 'amphibian' is in it.</span></p>
      <pre>grep -r amphibian /</pre>
    </div>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Wrapping Up</h5>
      <p>
        It is important to note that all of these commands are far more powerful than what I went over.
        For example, searching with regex is a common usecase.
        As is limiting the depth of recursive searches.
        The man pages have the full details for each command.
        But I hope this has you covered for your most common searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        To recap, use <code>find</code> to search for file and folder names.
        This command is recursive, and requires wildcard(s) for partial matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <code>grep</code> to search for text within a file.
        This command is not recursive by default, but can be with the -r flag.
        grep does return partial matches.
