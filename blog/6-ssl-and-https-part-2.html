    <h5 class="blog-title left">Setting Up Secure</h5>
    <p>
      We'll continue with the example presented in the
      <a href="4-ssl-and-https-beginners-guide.html">previous post</a>
      about our dentist.
      Because we are going to transmit sensitive information on our website,
      we decided to encrypt the data it sends by using HTTPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting this up is surprisingly easy. Unfortunately, it is webserver
      specific and out of scope for this post.
      But basically, you just need to set
      some flags in your Apache/Nginx/etc config files.
      You'd need to look up the specifics, but essentially you just set
      <code>secure = true</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, you are halfway there.  Now you just need an SSL Certificate,
      and to tell your webserver where that certificate lives.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">What is SSL?</h5>
    <p>
      There are a number of places you can buy an SSL certificate.
      For no good reason, I like
      <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates.aspx">namecheap</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main criteria when looking at SSL Certs.
      1.  What is the level of trust that I need. and
      2.  How many domains do I need covered?
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Trust</h5>
    <p>
      Looking at the first category: if you are a global bank, you need
      <em>a lot</em> of trust. For a customer to give you a significant amount
      of money, they need to know that you are who you say you and that
      you are keeping their stuff safe.  If you are a dentist, it's fair
      the say the level of trust is less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of that, you can buy a really expensive SSL cert that says to
      the world, "You can trust everything about this website."
      This cert costs a lot of money, because the certificate authorizer
      calls the company and talks to people and makes sure
      they are who they say they are. I don't know any of the specifics,
      but there is a complex vetting process that allows a certificate
      to be issued that convey "super high level of trust here".
    </p>
    <p>
      The level of certification is available for review in the address bar.
      This is what it looks like when I log into my bank account&mdash;
      <div><img src="../assets/images/ssl-strong.png"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      That big green box lets everyone know, PNC paid a lot of money
      to be properly vetted.  They are who they say they are and
      they encrypt their data.  You can trust them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digging down a little deeper, let's look at The New York Times.
      When I browse articles on their website, there is no need to
      encrypt the information.  They can send articles as plain-text
      back and forth.  This is what the url bar looks like&mdash;
      <div><img src="../assets/images/ssl-none.png"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I log in to my account at The New York Times, things change.
      In this section of the website, they keep addresses and take
      credit card information.  Here is the url bar&mdash;
      <div><img src="../assets/images/ssl-weak.png"></div>
      This says that the site is secure and trusted, but the level of
      trust is not as high as the first image.  That is, this cert
      is cheaper and there was less vetting.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Domains</h5>
    <p>
      This section is the less interesting of the two.
      The more subdomains your website has, the more expensive your SSL cert is.
      That is, as dentist you may only have 'greatdentist.com'.
      But some people have 'https://foo.mywebsite.com' and 'https://bar.mywebsite.com'.
      The more subdomains you have, the price goes up.
      You can buy a wildcard cert, that covers everything.  'https://*.mywebsite.com'.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">More with SSL</h5>
    <p>
      A basic SSL cert is ~$10.  A wildcard cert is ~$100.
      And a top-of-the-line enterprise cert is ~$1,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought my certificate... but now what?
      Well, follow the instructions.  The implementation details are outside
      the scope of this discussion.  Trust be told, this is the part that
      took me longer than it should have.
      But basically, you need to 'activate' the cert by filling out some questions
      and the issuer will send it to you via email.
      Then you need to transform the file sent to you to a CSR, which
      is just another file type.
      (There are lots of good resources with
      <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/467/67/how-do-i-generate-a-csr-code">instructions </a>
      .)
      Then copy that file onto your server, and update the webserver config
      files to let it know where it is saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file itself looks like a bunch of letters and numbers, but everything
      you've been approved for is hidden in that text.  And whenever someone
      goes to that address the level of trust is known and displayed.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">This Raises Some Questions</h5>
    <p> Q: Why isn't every website secure? </p>
    <p>
      A: They should be.  And they probably will be soon.  But right now,
      you can't force everyone to buy an SSL cert. More on this in a minute.
    </p>

    <p> Q: Why do SSL certs cost money? </p>
    <p>
      A: The company that issues the certs needs to make money.
      These companies know how to vet applications and have the resources to do it.
    </p>

    <p> Q: Can I make my site secure without an SSL cert? </p>
    <p>
      A: Yes. These things are not intrinsically coupled.  There is nothing that stops
      you from changes the settings on your webserver config to <code>secure = true</code>
      and not buying an SSL.
      However, when the web browser sees there is no valid SSL it issues a
      <a href="http://cdn.inmotionhosting.com/support/images/stories/website/errors/ssl/chrome-your-connection-is-not-private.png">BIG warning to the user</a>.
      So while technically this can be done, it is not practical for any
      consumer-facing website.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">The Future</h5>
    <p>
      It only makes sense for all sites to be secure. I press you to think of
      a usecase where insecure is preferred. It's not much extra work, and
      better to be safe than sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason,
      <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/">Mozilla recently</a>
      announced they are phasing out HTTP in Firefox.
      It is already deprecated.
      Google has
      <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure"> the same plans </a>
      with Chrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this a reality, it is now possible to get free (basic)
      SSL Certificates.
      <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>
      is a public benefit corporation (backed by big tech sponsors)
      that grant certs for $0.  They do not issue fancy certs
      and it looks like they are quicker to expire, but
      it is illustrative of the directions thing are moving in.
      Because without free SSL certificates, it is not reasonably
      possible to require all sites to use HTTPS.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Wrapping Up</h5>
    <p>
      I hope some aspects of HTTPS and SSL are clearer than they were before.
      I'm not an expert, I just changed two SSL certs that lapsed.
      If I've got something wrong, just let me know!!
