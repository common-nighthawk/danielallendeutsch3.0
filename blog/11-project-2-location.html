    <h6 class="blog-title center">start: August 18, 2016, end: -</h6>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      I recently left my full-time job in New York.
      This deserves a dedicated blog post, and I plan to do that
      once I can properly organize my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a big part of why I left is:
      1. I want to spend time traveling and (what I've been calling) 'city shopping'.
      2. I want to spend time building all sorts of fun tech projects.
      Anything that makes me and/or other people happy is the only criterion.
      Importantly, I'm hoping these projects will also drive learning in new areas for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my <a href="../about.html">About</a> page, it says "Daniel is a web developer that lives in Brooklyn, New York."
      That's no longer true! I want to update this so that it pulls in dynamically from my current location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mostly, I just think this is fun.
      I like the idea of going somewhere for a weekend,
      and my website updating automatically.
      Realistically, there is no obvious benefit.
      But maybe my family/friends will enjoy having a reliable way of knowing
      where I am.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">The Specs</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="../about.html">About</a> page should say:
        "Daniel is a web developer currently living in {{city}}, {{state}}."
      </li>
      <li>No action is required for the city and state to update</li>
      <li>My location is accurate within 24-hours</li>
      <li>This website remains static: HTML, CSS, and JS only (no backend)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Initial Plan</h5>
    <p>
      I want this to work based on the location of my phone;
      my phone is always on and always with me.
      But I don't know much about mobile, so I'm going to build the first
      iteration using the location of my laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a regular frequency (every hour?) I will post my location to a remote database.
      I will then fetch the location with JavaScript on the client-side, on each page load.
      Easy!
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Approaches</h5>
    <p>
      This project appears to have 3 or 4 parts.
      The first is the database, to store my location.
      The second is the client-side code, to fetch the location.
      The third is posting my location.
      If I post all details related to my location, that's it.
      But if I just post some information,
      the fourth will be a service that transforms the given information
      into everything required.
    </p>
    <h6 class="blog-title left">Database</h6>
    <p>
      I don't want to be bothered much with the DB.
      My needs are small&mdash;I just want to store simple data remotely.
      Therefore, it seems ridiculous to set up and maintain a dedicated server.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, I think
      <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
      will be a good fit.
      I used it a while ago for a small project.
      The major benefits are that:
      1. I don't have to manage anything myself and
      2. it's free(!) for non-enterprise projects.
    </p>

    <h6 class="blog-title left">Client-Side Fetching</h6>
    <p>
      This should be fairly simple.
      Once the remote endpoint is set up correctly,
      the location can be retrieved with <code>$.get</code>
      and the DOM can be updated with <code>$(#city).html(city)</code>.
    </p>

    <h6 class="blog-title left">Posting the Location</h6>
    <p>
      This will be the hard part.
      On first-pass, I will write a shell script that
      uses my current IP address to determine my city and state.
      Then post that to the remote Firebase DB.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not great with bash, but I believe
      simple APIs exist to find city/state from an IP.
      I'm hoping I can accomplish everything with <code>curl</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run the script regularly, I will use <code>cron</code>
      to call it every hour
      <a href="#footer-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This should work on my laptop.
      However, it will not transition nicely to mobile.
      That is, I cannot run a <code>cron</code> job on my phone.
      And finding the city and state will be more difficult without <code>curl</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
      Will I need to build a whole Android App, or does something already exist?
      I can see just posting my IP address from mobile, and running a service
      to transform that into city/state.
      I can either use <code>cron</code> on a remote server or use
      something like AWS Lambda.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Learning Objectives</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>become more familiar with Firebase</li>
      <li>gain experience writing bash scripts</li>
      <li>learn about development on mobile</li>
      <li>
        if appropriate, check out "serverless" (all the rage!)
        and event-driven computing with
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">The Code: Laptop</h5>
    <p>
      The good news is that is works! <a href="../about.html">About</a>.

    <p>
      TODO: write up the story of creating the script.
      <!-- <a href="#footer-2"><sup>2</sup></a> -->

      The code for the
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/common-nighthawk/dd1ead0ff48c70c0f5fc2d5cd190aa4c">shell script</a>
      and the code for the

      are available on Github.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">The Code: Mobile</h5>
    <p>
      TODO: implementation and write-up. Figure out all the stuff.
    </p>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Outstanding Questions</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        is there a better way to get my location?
        Specifically, I know that every move of my Android phone is tracked by Google.
        Is there a convenient API to access the location data
        so that I avoid the entire process of finding and posting myself?
      </li>
      <li>
        is my approach right?
        If there's a better way, I'd absolutely love to hear about it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Takeaways</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">JavaScript</span> &mdash;
        I tricked myself into thinking I know JavaScript
        because I can manipulate the DOM.
        Trying to write simple code to handle data
        gave me a lot of trouble.
        And I'm not happy with the code:
        <code>allDateTimes[Math.max(...Object.keys(allDateTimes))]</code>.
        Also, I forgot that JS is not a high-level language.
        It's often used in the same sentence as Ruby and Python,
        but it does not have nearly as many convenience methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Bash</span> &mdash;
        I first tried to write the script using pure bash.
        I found myself trying to do crazy manipulations with
        <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>.
        I'm not sure if the problem is that bash is the wrong tool
        or that I don't know how to use it well enough.
        I wanted to use bash because I thought that would translate
        to mobile better, but that might not be true.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Ruby</span> &mdash;
        I went through many iterations of this code.
        Because it started as bash, the first pass in Ruby
        was without any classes. Straight calls top to bottom.
        Then I got carried away, and made it very Object Oriented.
        (I had two classes, and then broke it down even more into three.)
        I'm happy with the code, but worried I'm forcing everything into
        the paradigms I'm familiar with when there are better ways.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="blog-title left">Closing</h5>
    <p>
      I'm happy I got this working relatively quickly.
      I think it's a neat update to the <a href="../about.html">About</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting this working on mobile will be more interesting.
      I need to do some reading about Bash.
      I will update this post as I continue working on this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to Michigan this weekend, so we'll see if it works!

    a note about <code>cron</code>.
    I heard the term used for over a year, and always thought
    "I'm a web developer. That's a tool used by Systems people."
    <code>cron</code> is now one of my favorite tools.
    It comes in handy all of the time, and is simple to use.
    If you're not familiar with it, definitely check it out.
    It allows you to schedule recurring jobs.
