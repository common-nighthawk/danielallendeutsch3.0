      Daniel is a web developer that lives in Brooklyn, New York.  He passionately loves clean and clever code.<br><br>
      <!-- He spent ~5 years working on the business side of things, before transitioning to the technical side. -->
      <!-- Feeling infinitely more at home with code and servers, he is greatful for the business knowledge he gained in those years. -->

      He prefers burritos to tacos, and wishes he watched a little less television.
      For reasons unknown, he has strong affinities for the Oxford comma and double sentence spacing.
      He gets slightly maniacal when talking about Vim.<br><br>
